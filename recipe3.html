            <h3>Method</h3>
           
            
            <li> 1. Combine yeast, salt, sugar and warm water in a jug. Stir with a fork. Cover with plastic wrap.
                 Set aside in a warm place for 5 minutes or until bubbles form on surface. Sift flour into a large bowl.
                  Add yeast mixture and 2 tablespoons oil. Mix to form a soft dough.</li>
               

                
            <li> 2. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for 8 minutes or until smooth and elastic.
                 Place in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Set aside in a warm place for 15 to 20 minutes (on a hot day) or until doubled in size.
                  Preheat oven to 220Â°C. Brush a large baking tray with remaining oil.</li> 
                

             <li> 3.  Punch dough with your fist. Knead gently on a lightly floured surface. Cut dough into 4 pieces. 
                Knead each piece into a ball. Roll each ball into a 24cm (diameter) round.</li>    
                

             <li> 4. Arrange a quarter of the pancetta, mushroom, cheese and rocket over half of each round, leaving a 2cm border around the edge.
                 Brush edge with water. Fold dough over to enclose filling. Press edges together to seal.</li>       

              <li>5. Place calzones on prepared tray. Brush tops with egg. Sprinkle with sea salt and pepper.
                 Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden and crisp. Serve.</li>
